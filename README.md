# VRDL HW4 - Image Super Resolution

## Deadline is 2022/01/13 23:59

## Introduction

Image superresolution is a task that restore image from low resolution. It can use in surveillance, medical, media, and ...etc. In medical, capturing high-resolution MRI images can be tricky, so deep learning can use to get better resolution image and less time. Same in media, we can transport low media low-resolution frames but enjoy high-resolution video.

## Installation

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Train

```cmd
python main_train_psnr.py --opt options/swinir/train_swinir_sr_classical.json
```

You should put high resolution train image into `KAIR\trainsets\trainH`, then you can start to train.

## Eval

```cmd
python main_test_swinir.py --task classical_sr --scale 3 --training_patch_size 48 --model_path <model path> --folder_gt <high resolution test data folder>
```

High resolution test data folder default is setting as `KAIR\testsets\HW4_test\HR`, and low resolution test data will automatic produce by matlab bicublic, same as train.

Sample eval command:  

```cmd
python main_test_swinir.py --task classical_sr --scale 3 --training_patch_size 48 --model_path superresolution/swinir_sr_classical_patch48_x3/models/61500_G.pth --folder_lq testsets/HW4_test/LR_bicubic/X3 --folder_gt testsets/HW4_test/HR_sample
```

You can download model Weight in sample code and put it into dir `superresolution/swinir_sr_classical_patch48_x3/models` to run sample eval code.

## Methodology

### Data pre-process

Only need to provide HR image , and corresponding LR image will produce automatically with matlab bicublic.

### Model architecture

Please reference "SwinIR: Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer"[3] to know the whole model detail.

### Hyperparameters

Optimizer: Adam  
Optimizer lr: 2e-4  
Loss: L1

## Result

Final score of PSNR is 27.8064.
